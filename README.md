Foundations I - Lab: Python Programming - pizza_order_cost.py

Welcome to the Python Pizza Order Cost Calculator Lab! In this hands-on exercise, you'll step into the shoes of a junior employee at a pizza delivery company. Your mission is to create a Python script that calculates the total cost of a pizza order based on various factors. This lab will help you practice essential Python programming concepts such as user input, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and string formatting.

By the end of this lab, you'll have created a practical, real-world application that demonstrates your ability to apply Python programming skills to solve business problems. Let's get started!

Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you should be able to:

Use Python's input() function to gather user data
Implement conditional statements (if-elif) to make decisions based on input
Perform arithmetic calculations to determine costs
Use f-strings for formatted output
Apply problem-solving skills to create a functional program
Scenario
You work for a pizza delivery company that needs a program to calculate order costs. The company has specific pricing rules:

Pizza sizes and base prices:
Small pizza: $8
Large pizza: $12
Toppings: $1 for each additional topping
Delivery fee:
$2 for the first 5 miles
$1 for each additional mile
Your task: Create a Python script that prompts the user for order details, calculates the total cost, and displays the result.

Problem-Solving Process
Before getting started, let's review the problem-solving process:

Understand the problem
Plan the solution
Implement the solution
Test and debug
Use this process to guide you through the lab steps.

Lab Instructions
Step 1: Define the Problem 

Create a Python script named pizza_order_cost.py that calculates the total cost of a pizza order based on:

Pizza size
Number of toppings
Delivery distance
Step 2: Design a Solution

Design a solution using pseudocode. Use the following steps as a guide:

Prompt the user for inputs:
Pizza size (small or large)
Number of toppings
Delivery distance in miles
Calculate the base cost of the pizza using conditional statements.
Calculate the cost of toppings.
Calculate the delivery fee.
Sum up the total cost.
Display the result using an f-string.
Step 3: Implement the Solution

Using your pseudocode design, write the Python code to implement your solution. Open your favorite Python editor and create a new file named pizza_order_cost.py. Then, follow these steps:

Start by adding comments to outline the structure of your program.
Implement the user input section, using input() function and appropriate type conversion.
Use if-elif statements to determine the base cost of the pizza.
Calculate the cost of toppings.
Implement the delivery fee calculation.
Calculate the total cost.
Use an f-string to display the result.
Step 3: Test and Debug

After implementing your solution:

Run your script and test it with various inputs to ensure it works correctly
Check for edge cases, such as:
Ordering a pizza with no extra toppings.
Ordering for pickup (0 miles delivery distance).
Ordering a large pizza with many toppings and long delivery distance.
If you encounter any errors or unexpected results, debug your code and make necessary adjustments.
Submission and Grading Instructions
Review your code to ensure it meets all requirements outlined in the lab instructions and the rubric below.
When you're satisfied with your solution, submit your completed pizza_order_cost.py script using one of the following methods:
Text file
File upload
Video walkthrough (explaining your code and demonstrating its functionality)
URL link (if you've hosted your code on a platform like GitHub)
