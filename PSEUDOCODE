PSEUDOCODE SOLUTION

Prompt the user for inputs:
  - Pizza size (small or large)
  - Number of toppings
  - Delivery distance in miles

Determine the base cost of the pizza based on size:
  IF size equals "small" THEN
        SET base_cost to 8
    ELSE IF size equals "medium" THEN
        SET base_cost to 10
    ELSE IF size equals "large" THEN
        SET base_cost to 12
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "Invalid pizza size. Please enter small, medium, or large."
        EXIT program
    END IF

Calculate the cost of toppings:
  SET toppings_cost to toppings * 1

Calculate the delivery fee:
  IF distance is less than or equal to 0 THEN
        SET delivery_fee to 0
    ELSE IF distance is between 5 and 10 (inclusive) THEN
        SET delivery_fee to 2
    ELSE IF distance is greater than 10 THEN
        SET delivery_fee to 3
    ELSE
        SET additional_miles to distance - 5
        SET delivery_fee to 2 + additional_miles
    END IF

Calculate total cost:
  SET total_cost to base_cost + toppings_cost + delivery_fee

Display order summary:
  DISPLAY "--- Order Summary ---"
    DISPLAY "Pizza Size: " + capitalize(size)
    DISPLAY "Base Cost: $" + format_decimal(base_cost, 2)
    DISPLAY "Number of Toppings: " + toppings
    DISPLAY "Toppings Cost: $" + format_decimal(toppings_cost, 2)
    DISPLAY "Delivery Distance: " + distance + " miles"
    DISPLAY "Delivery Fee: $" + format_decimal(delivery_fee, 2)
    DISPLAY "Total Cost: $" + format_decimal(total_cost, 2)
    DISPLAY "Thank you for your order!"
